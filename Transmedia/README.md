them would definitely benefit our narrative.
3. Worldbuilding
3.1. When the story occurs?
The story occurs in what seems as the present state of our world.
Though by focusing primarily on futuristic aspects, we believe it
will help our project age well.
3.2. Which is the central world where the project is set?
The central world is the entire world as our main character is
forced to change locations. For technical reasons we couldn’t
achieve that so we strived to depict her life in a contemporary city.
3.3. Is it a fictional world, the real
world or a mixture of both?
It’s a mixture of both. The world is realistic but there are
implications of supernatural phenomenons. ( Magical Realism)
3.4. How it is presented geographically?
We filmed everything in Syros, but we tried to film on less iconic
locations so the viewer can paint a more relatable depiction of the
rest of the world based on their own reality.
3.5. How the world looks?
The world is depicted differently based on our main character’s
emotional state.
In the beginning it looks bright and futuristic, sporting a variety of
different saturated colors. Her home and office are ultimately
inspired by the Scandinavian style because it’s the movement that
most middle-class people strive to be able to choose as one of the
more affordable options for luxury. Despite that, apart from some
playful touches, her home is fairly minimalistic and simple. The
balcony of her office building has some amazing views of the city.
The scenes of her “new money” days are focusing on the bright
aspects of a fantasy we all have: being able to afford everything
we dream of. So we chose shops and the beach bar that convey
that the best. Her private pool is a contemporary swimming pool.
As her mental and emotional state gets progressively worse, her
world changes to one of darker and murkier colors.
We are being shown the underbelly of our society, one that we are
always so quick to cover up and avoid. The drug addicts,
crackhouses, homelessness, overdosing under a bridge.
When our main character starts accepting her fate, the world gets
brighter once again, only this time there is no fantasy. Just plain
old everyday reality. A neighborhood with old forgotten buildings,
a house full of garbage and old furniture, yet the sun shines
through.
3.6. What challenges, dangers, or
delights are inherent to this
world?
The world doesn’t differ all that much from our own. It’s not free of
dangers like injustice, criminal activity, toxic work culture, burnout
and our declining mental state.
But it’s also one of everyday delights, those based on the
sweetness of experiencing simple pleasures, found only in the
presence, if one is open to acknowledge them.
Yet, there’s also an underlying threat of supernatural beings of
unknown origin. They seem to be able to make suspicious deals
with people and alter their current state of reality. With that
comes the metaphysical question of “what else is there?”.
3.7. Is the storyworld big enough to
support expansions?
The storyworld is as big as our current understanding of the
universe. Of course it can support infinite expansions, perhaps of
different stories of people that have accepted such a deal.
4. Characters
4.1. Who are the primary and
secondary characters of the
story?
Our main character, Chara, is a relatable woman in her 30s. We see
her desperately clinging on to elements of her childhood years (
her huge stuffed dog in her apartment, her unnatural hair color
and twin-bun hairstyle, her youthful outfit choices. Despite her
edging a state of chronic burnout, she’s trying to hold on to her
childhood dreams.
Our supporting cast is:
The strange figure we call “The notary” or “Dealmaker”.
It’s a creature of unknown origins, though clearly inspired by
people making strange deals with “the devil” in western folklore. It
doesn’t seem to have any empathy or regard for human life and
simply revels in the idea of human suffering.
It doesn’t seem to care about our main character outside the
extent of their deal, so it never contacts her after it.
One begs the question “how many lives exactly has this creature
ruined?”
The boss is a stern and somewhat cold figure. He moves in quick,
decisive and calculated ways. He has little time for unneeded
things like common courtesy, but of course he isn’t completely
devoid of human emotion. He fidgets with his clicker pen as a way
to relieve the tension in between meetings and firing inefficient
workers.
The snail is an equally mysterious creature. It seems like a
common everyday snail, and it sure moves as one. Yet, despite its
slow pace and it’s frail appearance, one can do little to nothing to
destroy it. It’s simply unkillable. The best thing one can do is pay
someone to stick a gps tracker unit to its body, so that they can
be aware of its location to efficiently avoid it.
Chara’s friends seem fun to be around and charming, often
chasing after her so that they can get a taste of her glamorous
lifestyle for themselves. Of course, as the story progresses, we see
their true colors. They’re only here to have a good time and take
advantage of our protagonists’ assets. But they never make any
effort to be there for her when she’s having a bad time. They seem
to have completely abandoned her by the time her mental health
has reached rock bottom.
4.2. Does the project have any
spin-offs15? If so, who are the
spin-offs’ protagonists?
We haven’t made any plans for any spin-offs so far, but we made a
poem which is meant to put the listener to our characters place,
passing her emotions and thoughts to the listener.
4.3. Can the storyworld be considered
a primary character of its own?
If you’re willing to look that far into it.
4.4. Can the audience be considered
a character as well?
Kinda, in the beginning of the movie, Chara is talking to the viewer,
asking them questions about their life. During the course of the
movie, she is entrusting her feelings to the viewer like she would to
a close friend.
4.5. Are there non-player characters16
(NPCs) in this project? If so, who
are they and what kind of role do
they play (allies, adversaries,
helper figures, etc.)?
There are only non-player characters in this project. It’s a movie
with limited options for engagement from the viewer, apart from
personal introspection.
5. Extensions
5.1. How many extensions does the project have?
The main project is the short film and we have an extension of the
narrative for it. It is a narrated poem with the voice of our main
protagonist.
5.2. Are the extensions adaptations (the intersemiotic translation from
one system to another) or
expansions of the narrative
through various media?
The extensions are an expansion of the movie’s main focus and meaning
through a narrated poem.
5.3. Is each extension canonical?
Does it enrich the story?
It does enrich the story because it shows a more realistic and human
way of thinking. It shows the emotions and thoughts that one may
experience in the same situation.
5.4. Does each extension maintain the
original characteristics of the
world?
No, the poem is made in a way so that the listeners can interpret it as
they wish. The one thing that is left intact is the struggle that the main
character went through and the road to acceptance.
5.5. Does each extension answer
questions left previously
unanswered?
The poem is not answering any unanswered questions. Everything is
answered in the story.
5.6. Does each extension raise new questions?
No, the poem is just a narrative from the protagonist’s feelings, leaving
room for imagination and interpretation.
5.7. Do the extensions open up new possibilities for additional
expansion?
The extension itself is pretty limited to the way it can evolve to
something different other than that.
5.8. Do the extensions have the
ability to spread the content
and also to provide the possibility
to explore the narrative in-depth?
Yes, the poem can be listened to before and after the movie so it can
mean different things for each individual person depending on when or
if they listened to it.
6. Media platforms and genres
6.1. What kind of media platforms
(film, book, comics, games, and
so forth) are involved in the
project?
This project involves short live action film and a narrated poem
6.2. Which devices (computer, game
console, tablet, mobile phone,
etc.) are required by the project?
The short film, depending on the distribution, requires any device with
access to streaming platforms such as Youtube or Netflix. For the
narrated poem it is also required of the user to have access to
streaming platforms in addition to audio only content (etc. Spotify)
6.3. How each platform is participating and contributing to the
whole project? What are their functions in the project?
The way we are distributing our content, it allows for a wider audience to
have access to our project, making it a lot easier for them to share our
work
6.4. What are the distinctive characteristics of each media platform?
There are no distinctions between the streaming platforms other than
their ease to distribute it. We could also send our project to
competitions so it can reach a different kind of audience
6.5. Identify problems that are specific of each medium.
The main medium (short film) was a lot harder to create due to the
limitations of our location, budget, equipment etc. The poem had a lot
of revisions made in order to keep a balance between storytelling and
free expression of each listener.
6.6. Is each medium really relevant to the project?
The movie is relevant to the project, because it develops the story
prompt. The poem is made in a way that you don’t have to listen to it to
understand the story.
6.7. What is the roll-out strategy to
release the platforms?
The Roll-out strategy is through social media sharing, taking part in a
short movie contest for exposure.
6.8. Which genres (action, adventure, detective, science fiction, fantasy,
and so forth) are present in the project?
The main genre is Drama, with elements of Comedy.
7. Audience and market
7.1. What is the target audience of
the project? Who is the intended
VUP?
Our target audience is people above 16 years old because of explicit
images.
7.2. What kind of “viewers” (real-time,reflective, and navigational) does the
project attract?
We believe our works will attract some navigational viewers. When one of
them is exposed to one of our projects he will seek out the other one in
order to create a bigger picture of our story, meanings and characters.
7.3. What kind of entertainment does the target audience enjoy?
A dramatic situation that was also made popular through social media
in the form of a short movie.
7.4. What kind of technology/devices
are people in this group involved
with?
Mainly mobile phones and laptops or stationary computers.
7.5. Why does this project appeal
to them?
The theme of the movie is a question that everyone has been asked and
has tried to answer. It’s a what if i said yes, type of thing.
7.6. Do other projects like this exist?
The theme of the film (what choices in life we make, what defines a
happy life), has been expressed quite excessively in many media forms.
The way we make explore this theme though (with using a meme about
the immortal snail), is rather unheard of.
Do they succeed in achieving their
purpose?
Yes they do, mainly because this whole story is inspired from an original
meme that gained massive exposure in 2016 on reddit and again in 2021
on TikTok.
7.7. What is the project’s business model?
There was no business model.
7.8. Revenue-wise, was the project
successful? Why?
This project was made as a university project, so no revenue was made.
In theory, if we distributed through online services. Our revenue would
be through ads.
8. Engagement
8.1. Through what point of view (PoV)
does the VUP experience this world: first-person, second-person,
third-person, or a mixture of them?
The VUP experiences the world through the life of our protagonist
(Chara). This makes a third person experience.
8.2. What role does the VUP play in
this project?
They are just an observer, watching the world being built around the
main character and her decision
8.3. How the project keeps the VUP
engaged?
Music, a realistic approach to the concept, fantasy aspects and very
cool cinematic shots.
8.4. What are the mechanisms of
interaction in this project?
The VUP cannot interact with the project more than watching it.
8.5. Is there also participation involved in the project? If so, how can the
VUP participate in the open system?
The VUP has no means of interaction with the system.
8.6. Does the project work as cultural
attractor/activator?
No ,the project doesn’t work as a cultural attractor.
8.7. How does the VUP affect the
outcome? What do they add to
the storyworld?
The do not affect the outcome whatsoever
8.8. Are there UGC related to the story (parodies, recaps, mash-ups, fan
communities, etc.)?
The story is based on a meme that was posted a while ago on Reddit.
8.9. Does the project offer the VUP the possibility of immersion into
the storyworld?
Due to the lack of interaction with the project, immersion is quite
unlikely. However, if the viewer connects with our main character and
sees himself in her, we can theorise that some level of immersion will be
achieved.
8.10. Does the project offer the VUP the possibility to take away elements
of the story and incorporate them into everyday
life?
The meaning of the story and the feelings the VUP felt can be
incorporated into everyday life.
8.11. Is there an important goal that
the VUP is trying to accomplish
in the project?
There are no goals that are made clear for the VUP. However, our goal as
creators is to make our VUPs to self-reflect, even for just a little bit.
8.12. What will make the VUP want to
spend time accomplishing this
Goal?
The main motivation of the VUP to accomplish our goal is through the
anticipation. Meaning, he wants to sit through our short film all the way
in order to experience the ending.
8.13. What adds tension to the experience? Are there any ticking
Clocks?
During the first act, the tension comes from the choice that the main
character will make. Later on in the film, the feeling of the constant
manhunt by the snail, adds to that tension. The ticking clock is the
lifespan of the MC.
8.14. Is there a system of rewards
and penalties?
No, there are no such systems.
9. Structure
9.1. When did the transmediation begin? Is it a proactive or retroactive TS
project?
The project is a proactive TS. It was required for the project to create two
types of media for the same story.
9.2. Is it possible to identify any consequences for the project caused by
the fact that this is either a pro-active or a retroactive transmedia story?
We do not believe that there was any real, damaging consequence. In
fact, it helped us organise our timeline so there was enough time for
both media.
9.3. Is this project closer to a transmedia franchise, a portmanteau
transmedia story, or a complex transmedia experience?
Our project is much closer to a portmanteau transmedia story. Both
works were created to complement one another.
9.4. Can each extension work as an
independent entry point for the
Story?
No, it’s just a poem that expresses the feelings of the protagonist
following the main story line
9.5. What are/were possible endpoints of the project?
We believe watching a movie from start to finish is the best way to
experience it
9.6. How is the project structured? What are the major units of
Organisation?
The project was made by 4 university students. Right from the get go, all
four of us had equal say concerning our project and how it should be
made.
9.7. How could a map of the story-world be presented?
Because the projects don’t support interaction with the VUPs, one way to
present a story-world map is through a website that. In order to have
access to the website, at the end of each medium (short film, poem) the
link will be presented to the VUPs, creating a sense of curiosity.
10. Aesthetics
10.1. What kinds of visuals are being
used (animation, video, graphics,
a mix) in the project?
For the primary movie, we use video footage taken by a digital
mirrorless camera.
For the secondary narrated poem, we use illustrations created by
Artificial intelligence, animated on hand and brought to life using
computer software.
10.2. Is the overall look realistic
or a fantasy environment?
It’s meant to look realistic with a touch of futurism and a slightly
uncanny valley effect, meant to induce mild discomfort to the
viewer, in service of making them feel slightly unsettled, to ponder
a bit about their own life.
10.3. Is it possible to identify specific design styles in the project?
Yes! The houses we chose to film in are heavily inspired by the
Scandinavian Modern movement.
10.4. How does audio work in this
project? Is there ambient sound
(rain, wind, traffic noises, etc.),
sound effects, music, and so forth?
In filming the movie, we encountered the problem of wind in some
of the scenes. Despite the difficulties of trying to get clean, crisp
audio, we figured that the natural ambient sounds of wind add to the
charm of some of the scenes, so we didn’t remove it. We used a
mixture of natural sounds and audio effects, all to enhance the
immersion of the viewing experience.
Some of the natural ambient sounds we used include the wind, the
sounds of a pool, the opening and closing of doors, the ambience of
rooms, and dogs barking being a natural response to our character’s
pleas to get her own life back. Some of the audio effects and songs
we used include the ominous sound of a bell when the strange
creature enters, the sounds of a cashing machine whenever our
character buys something, uplifting music during her glory days, as
well as sad cinematic music towards the end of her journey.
In the narrated poem we used a great microphone for enhanced
vocal clarity. This way, we can hear every little change of the
narrator's tone and expression. We added a background sound of
the natural ambience of the recording room, and we also added rain
and deep ocean sounds to enhance the moody and suffocating tone
of some parts of the poem. Last but not least, we used a song called
“Childhood” by a lesser known composer called Vitaliia Pavlova on
their channel called “Infinite Stream”. The gloomy and melancholic,
yet bittersweet tone of the song fits the theme of the poem like a
glove, ultimately making the bigger positive difference in the
experience.
